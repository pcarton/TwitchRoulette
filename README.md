#Description
  This is a small script that looks at your following list on [Twitch](twitch.tv) and allows you to either choose or randomly have a stream played through [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io) and the chat through [Chatty](http://chatty.github.io/)

#Requirements
  This requires you to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, along with Livestreamer (link above) installed and the chat client chatty (also above) in the same directory as the script

  ##OLD##
    (you may have to edit the version on line 150 of the script).

#Setup
  To set up the script, meet the requirements then find your [OAuth token for twitch](http://www.twitchapps.com/tmi/) and put that into the settings.py.txt file and remove the .txt extension so the file is a python file.

  ##OLD##
  Tweak the biases files to you liking, keeping the numbers as decimals and the '\*' character as the delimiter.
